# LifeSavingTips
LifeSaving Tips from vim, emacs, hotkeys and other ways to save time, as a result, improving life span.


## Tools to save time. But keep this in mind don't focus on methods, focus on principles.

```
As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.
